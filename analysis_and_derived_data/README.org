- open with [[http://www.libreoffice.org/][LibreOffice]] (or [[http://www.openoffice.org/][OpenOffice.org]])
- TP06 was completely dismissed because of constant talking: no way to
  tell difference between comment time and actual working on tasks.
- many data issues are not yet analyzed!
  - time spent on distractions
    - comments
    - item inspections
    - facilitator
    - distraction time while being in file management
    - distraction time while being in tagging mode
  - sum of folders
  - sum of tags
  - average tags/item
  - detailed list of tags per item
  - detail list of time the TPs spent for tagging each item
  - sum of copy processes from item drive to target drives (folders, tagstore)

** «Background_Q»

*** Description

Mostly German summary of the background questionnaires. Most important
things were additionally translated to English.

«Ja» means yes; «Nein» means no.

*** Notable Findings

- high education level
- good PC experience
- working 45h/week on computer
- most TPs working with MS Windows
- 50% is *not* using tagging
- majority is using hierarchical structure to manage emails

** «Feedback_Q»

*** Description

- Likert scale:
  - 0 ... best/fastest/yes
  - 6 ... worst/slowest/no

*** Notable Findings

- *78%* of the TPs would prefer tagstore over storing in a folder hierarchy!
- most TPs do think that tagstore provides a faster method

** «Test_Data_Summary»

*** Description

- Summarized view of [[*%C2%ABTest_Data%C2%BB][«Test_Data»]]
  - basis: overall task times without distractions like comments,
    bugs, inspection times, ...
- the re-find values of TP10 and TP15 were corrected because both TPs
  faced (technical) problems when re-finding item number three.
- last two columns reflect the re-find tasks without the first items
  - the first items took much longer than the rest and are therefore
    considered as «items to get used to the task»

*** Notable Findings

|         | filing folders | filing tagstore | re-finding folders | re-finding tagstore |
|---------+----------------+-----------------+--------------------+---------------------|
| average |            451 |             542 |                 25 |                  26 |
| stddev  |            148 |             240 |                  7 |                   8 |

- *filing tagstore was slower* than filing folders
  - p-value = 0.11
  - standard deviation is much greater when filing tagstore!
- *re-finding performance: no significant difference*
  - p-value = 0.94

- diagram of Filing Performance:
  - TPs performed very differently
    - compare to «[[*%C2%ABonly_fast_performer%C2%BB][only_fast_performer»]]  

** «Combined_Performance»

*** Description

The data consists of the sum of filing times for folders and tagstore,
sorted descending. The diagram visualizes the distribution.

*** Notable Findings

- only TP8 takes way longer than the other TPs

** «Distribution_Filing_tagstore»

*** Description

The filing times within tagstore are being sorted descending; a
diagram was derived.

*** Notable Findings

- three slow performers
  - TP 7, 8, 17
  - 66.6% of group 1, 33,3% of group 2
- six medium performers
  - TP 1, 3, 10, 12, 13, 18
  - 33,3% of group 1, 66,6% of group 2
- eight fast performers
  - TP 2, 4, 5, 9, 11, 14, 15, 16
  - 50% of group 1, 50% of group 2

- distribution among TP groups is very fair

** «wo_slow_ts_performer»

*** Description

- See «Notable Findings» of [[*%C2%ABDistribution_Filing_tagstore%C2%BB][«Distribution_Filing_tagstore»]]
- summary of the TP data without the slow performers TP 7, 8, and 17
- Assumption
  - removing a few slow performer may clear up the results

- Finding a sub-group without slow performer
  - sorted graph: filing in tagstore
  - clear difference for TPs 7, 6, and 17

*** Notable Findings

|         | filing folders | filing tagstore | re-finding folders | re-finding tagstore |
|---------+----------------+-----------------+--------------------+---------------------|
| average |            433 |             456 |                 24 |                  25 |
| stddev  |            117 |             156 |                  6 |                   7 |

- filing in tagstore is still slower compared to filing times in folders
- difference is much smaller though!
- standard deviations are more similar
- no substantial changes for re-finding tasks

** «only_fast_performer»

*** Description

- See «Notable Findings» of [[*%C2%ABDistribution_Filing_tagstore%C2%BB][«Distribution_Filing_tagstore»]]
- summary of the TP data of the fast performers TP 2, 4, 5, 9, 11, 14, 15, 16
  - equally distributed among the two TP groups
- very diverging filing performance among TP
  - high values for standard deviations
  - high fraction of task time relates to file management in general
- probably: TPs have different file management competence in general

- Assumption
  - slow performing TPs dilutes clearer differences in the results
    for example because of poor file management competence
  - finding and comparing within a fair TP subgroup may give more
    interesting results

- Finding a fair sub-group of fast filing performer
  - sorted graph: sum of filing time (folders and tagstore combined)
  - fastest eight TP are 50% in group 1 and 50% in group 2
  - TP: 2, 4, 5, 9, 11, 14, 15, 16
  - Usage of tagging systems (Background questionnaires):
    - fast performers: 3 of 8 (38%)
    - rest: 6 of 9 (67%)
    - therefore no speed advantage for TPs using tagging systems

*** Notable Findings

|         | filing folders | filing tagstore | re-finding folders | re-finding tagstore |
|---------+----------------+-----------------+--------------------+---------------------|
| average |            386 |             337 |                 24 |                  25 |
| stddev  |             86 |              56 |                  6 |                   8 |

- reversed result: *filing* in tagstore slightly faster(!) than filing
  in folders
  - p-value = 0.11
- standard deviations of filing more similar
  - less high, less difference
- similar results for *re-finding* performance as with all TPs

** «high_performer_vs_rest»

*** Description

This sheet visualizes miscellaneous values of the group of fast
performers compared to the rest.

*** Notable Findings

- filing_folders
  - Overall time without distractions
    - Here is a big difference but this is logical since we divided
      fast and slow performer
  - #M2F - number of move file actions from item drive to folder drive
    - fast average: 9.63
    - rest average: 6.56
    - It is remarkable that the *fast performers* actually *used more
      move file actions* than the rest
- filing_tagstore
  - percentage of file management time (or tagging time) to total time
    - fast performer and rest used approximately 75% for tagging and
      the rest for file management
    - no clear difference here
  - sum of distractions
    - fast average: 79.13s
    - rest average: 194.67s
    - big difference, *fast performers* were *not distracted* that much
      - NOTE: distraction times were removed for calculating results!
      - biggest difference could be found in file management
        distractions and (more in detail) inspection time
        - *fast performers did not re-inspect test items* that much
  - sum of tags, average tags/item
    - fast average: 67.75
    - rest average: 90.80
    - *fast performer used less tags*
  - tag proposals
    - only three of the fast performers and two of the rest clicked on
      proposed tags
    - NOTE: a full blown tag recommendation system is part of a later
      version of tagstore
  - tag defaults
    - most used tag entry usability feature: six of the high performer
      and eight of the rest used tag defaults from the previous
      item tagged
    - slightly less often used by fast performers
  - tag completion
    - used by five of the fast performers and seven of the rest
    - no clear difference
  - #m2t - number of *move file actions* from item drive to tagstore
    storage folder
    - fast average: 3.88
    - rest average: 8.56
    - *fast performer used fewer move actions to tagstore*
      - *opposite finding to filing in folders*
    - Interpretations:
      - A higher number of move actions from item folder to tagstore
        might produce more task switching effort for TPs
- refinding_folders
  - number of mouse clicks
    - fast average sum: 19.38
    - rest average sum: 18.68
    - *no difference in average number of mouse clicks*
- refinding_tagstore
  - number of mouse clicks
    - fast average sum: 14.45
    - rest average sum: 13,46
    - *no difference in average number of mouse clicks*

** refinding_clicks

|                     | sum of average mouse clicks per item |
|---------------------+--------------------------------------|
| re-finding folder   | 19.00                                |
| re-finding tagstore | 13.92                                |

p-value: <0.01

**** Notable Finding

- *re-finding in tagstore takes fewer mouse clicks*

** «Test_Data»
*** Description

This tab is a combined view for the raw CSV imports from:
- transcripts/filing_folders.csv
- transcripts/filing_tagstore.csv
- transcripts/refinding_folders.csv
- transcripts/refinding_tagstore.csv

Mostly as reference to the sheets ending with «_raw».

*** Notable Findings

see «[[*%C2%ABTest_Data_Summary%C2%BB][Test_Data_Summary]]»

** sheets ending with «_raw»

Those are the raw CSV imports from the files:
- transcripts/filing_folders.csv
- transcripts/filing_tagstore.csv
- transcripts/refinding_folders.csv
- transcripts/refinding_tagstore.csv

We manually added the first column «TP» for making clear which row
belongs to which Test Person.

** sheets beginning with «filing_» or «refinding_» (not ending with «_raw»)

The re-finding raw-pages contain rows with multiple entries
(lists). We split up those lists into separate spreadsheet columns to
be able to analyze them more easily.

** sheets beginning with «data_» and ending with «_performer»

 - *fast performer*: see description of [[*%C2%ABonly_fast_performer%C2%BB][«only_fast_performer»]]
 - *medium performer* and *slow performer*
   - the combination is the inverse of the fast performers
   - see findings of [[*%C2%ABDistribution_Filing_tagstore%C2%BB][«Distribution_Filing_tagstore»]]
 - split into medium and slow performers is because of filing
   performance in tagstore (only)
 - therefore most of the comparisons do only make sense between fast
   performer and the rest

The sheets here contain the linked data of the related group(s) of
TPs.

We were using batch files to set up, preserve state, and reset states
of TP folder hierarchies and tagstores.

We were using locally mapped drive letters for the three purposes of:
- (raw) test items
  - pre-filled with the test items
- folder structure drive
  - empty for any new TP
- tagstore drive
  - containing the basic folders for storing and re-finding files
    using [[http://tagstore.org][tagstore]]
  - no files in storage folder, no previously tags

- tp_00_init_all.bat
  - initialize everything, re-setting test items, folder drive, and
    tagstore drive, re-starting a fresh instance of tagstore
  - used before a new TP entered the room
- tp_01_pause.bat
  - asks for a TP number
  - kills any python task (tagstore)
  - saves TP data to a special location
  - used after a TP finished the first part, starting into pause,
    saving TP data state
- tp_02_restore.bat
  - re-establishes TP data state
  - used before a TP started the second part of the experiment

The scripts worked only for our set up during the experiment. You have
to adopt at least the paths by yourself!

Those scripts were *very* handy during the experiment. You definitely
have to use a comparable automatism too!

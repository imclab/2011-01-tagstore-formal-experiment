The revision 226 of tagstore was used for this experiment.

- configuration used: one tag line, no controlled vocabulary (TP could
  use any tag they wanted)
- tagging dialog had several features to make tagging experience as
  smooth as possible
  - tag completion (of already used tags)
  - basic tag recommendations for quickly selecting tags
- tag recommendations: a mixture of the most recently and the most
  often used tags
  - a tag recommender system was added long after the experiment
- no tag overview or tag cloud
  - added long after the experiment

- Installing this version
  - Prerequisites
    - Python 2.x runtime
    - PyQt
    - PyWin
    - Qt

Unfortunately tagstore Rev 226 also had some annoying bugs:

- tagstore background process was killed when user clicks on the «x»
  of the window decoration on the upper corner
  - fixed in later versions
  - we had to re-start all tests where this happened (two times,
    pretty much at the beginning of the tests)
- rarely, tagstore did not show up on the first usage
  - facilitator had to fix this
  - time of fixing tagstore is always subtracted from TP time
- only the first tagstore appearance was most of the time in the
  background
  - this happened basically only when showing tagstore for the first
    time by the facilitator
- items containing German umlaut characters keep shown as un-tagged
  - all times where TP tagged an already tagged Umlaut-item were
    subtracted from the experiment

The Windows XP system used in the test had also some annoying bugs:

- Adobe Acrobat Reader freezes until the mouse was moved outside the
  Acrobat Reader Window
  - TP learned how to handle this bug while exploring the items before
    the important tasks.
